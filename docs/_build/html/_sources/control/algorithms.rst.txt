What's Included
===============

The following algorithms are implemented in the Machine Learning Control package:

- `Soft Actor-Critic`_ (SAC)
- `Lyapunov Actor-Critic`_ (LAC)

They are all implemented with `MLP`_ (non-recurrent) actor-critics, making them suitable for fully-observed, non-image-based RL environments, e.g. the `Gym Mujoco`_ environments.

Machine Learning Control has two implementations for each algorithm: one that uses `PyTorch`_ as the neural network library, and one that uses `Tensorflow v2`_ as the neural network library.
