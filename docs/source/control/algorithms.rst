Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Reinforcement learning are all implemented with `MLP`_ (non-recurrent) actor-critics,
making them suitable for fully-observed, non-image-based RL environments, e.g.,
the `Gym Mujoco`_ environments. The :mlc:`Machine Learning Control <>` currently contains
the following RL agents:

Imitation Learning Agents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. todo::
   No Imitation Learning agents have been implemented. We are planning to add Imitation Learning
   agents in the future.
