What This Is
============

Welcome to the `Machine Learning Control`_ (MLC) framework! The Machine Learning Control framework that enables
you to create automatically, train and deploy RL control algorithms from data. This framework is made up of four main modules:


- `Modeling`_: Module that can be used to create an Openai gym environment out of real data.
- `Simzoo`_: Module that contains several already created `Machine Learning Control`_ Openai gym environments.
- `Control`_: Module used to train several `Machine Learning Control`_ RL learning agents on the built gym environments.
- `Hardware`_: Module that can be used to deploy the trained RL agents onto the hardware of your choice.

.. warning::

    The Machine Learning Control framework is still in its development state. We can therefore not guarantee that it is bug free.
    Please open `an issue` if you experience problems or something is unclear.
