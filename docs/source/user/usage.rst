How to use
==========

Through the CLI
===============

The BLC package comes with a handy :ref:`CLI <runner>`. You can use this CLI to invoke
the utilities of each of the four directly BLC modules. You can use the
following command to check which utilities are available quickly:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m bayesian_learning_control.run --help

See the corresponding module documentation for more information on a given utility.

Running the scripts directly
============================

Additionally, you can use each of the Algorithms and scripts in this package in stand-alone mode. This
means you can run the script directly from the terminal or your favourite IDE.
